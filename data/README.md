Data 

1. Experiment Data
- Place the contents of the `data.zip` downloaded  from the shared link here. Otherwise, running the code will populate this directory with data.

2. Pre-trained Models
- Apart from the above, the pre-trained models (listed in Appendix C, Table 1) will be downloaded here when you run `src/utils/download_models.py`, except for the `v3_adv-ens4` model, you will need to download it manually from [here](https://bit.ly/2XWTdKx), unpack it, and use the script below to convert its `checkpoint` to a `Saver-v1` version to be read by the code. Store the produced `ens_adv_inception_v3.ckpt` file at the `data/imagenet_models/` directory which will be generated by the `src/utils/download_models.py`.

```
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.Session()
saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph("ens4_adv_inception_v3.ckpt.meta")
saver.restore(sess, "ens4_adv_inception_v3.ckpt")
saver_v1 = tf.train.Saver(write_version=tf.train.SaverDef.V1)
saver_v1.save(sess, "ens_adv_inception_v3.ckpt", write_meta_graph=False, write_state=False)
```

3. Image Datasets

- MNIST data will be downloaded here automatically when you run the experiments.
- CIFAR10 data will be downloaded when you run `src/utils/download_cifar10.py`
- IMAGENET data (validation set) needs to be downloaded manually and the configuration files for attacks on IMAGENET need to be updated accordingly to point to the dataset path. E.g., in `src/config-jsons/imagenet_sign_linf_config.json`, the following line must be updated
```
"data_dir": "PATH_TO_IMGNET_VALID_SET/imagenet/tf_val_set"
```


In summary, the structure of this directory will be
```
mnist_data/
mnist_models/
cifar10_data/
cifar10_models/
imagenet_models/
keep_k_res/
blackbox_attack_exp/
... and the rest of data.zip contents
```
